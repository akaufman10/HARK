'''
This is a brief demonstration of parallel processing in HARK using HARKparallel.
A benchmark consumption-saving model is solved for individuals whose CRRA varies
between 1 and 8.  The infinite horizon model is solved serially and then in
parallel.  Note that HARKparallel will not work "out of the box", as Anaconda
does not include two packages needed for it.  See HARKparallel.py.
